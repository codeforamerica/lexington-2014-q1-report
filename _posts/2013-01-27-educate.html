      <h3>Project Ideation</h3>
      <p>
        The team then conducted research on each of the topic areas. The goal of this phase was to identify some potential projects and select something to experiment with for the first few weeks of the initial iteration cycle. The team came up with the following projects:
      </p>
      <dl>
        <dt>
          Waste management notifications:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          A system for automated notifications related to waste management, connected to RouteWare, that would provide customized information to those who opted in based on their locations.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          Interactive and illustrated city org and process chart:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          As a response to lack of knowledge of how to get things done when working with LFUCG, this site would provide an interactive flowchart to help answer “How do I…” type questions.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          Lexington tour guide:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          In order to get more people excited about exploring different parts of Lexington, this application would allow a user to input a spreadsheet of addresses and receive a map of a routed walking tour between those locations.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          Vacant lots mapping:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Lexington has a fair share of underutilized spaces, so this site would show a map of vacant lots in the city with links to information about what might be able to be developed in those spaces.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          Neighborhood competitions through data:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          An emphasis on getting city and neighborhood data out to the public led the team to consider an application containing rankings and comparisons between neighborhoods based on data provided by the city. The application would update in real-time, provide user-friendly data visualizations, and include information that would be interesting to view in aggregate.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          Code enforcement visualization and information sharing:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Lack of knowledge about what constitutes a code violation (and leads to a fine) is an issue, so this site would outline what acts are violations of municipal code in friendly language with interesting data and graphics.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          Input on proposals for city grants:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Based on the assumption that neighborhood engagement can come from providing input on community projects, this application would allow Lexingtonians to vote on grant proposals for projects in their neighborhoods.
        </dd>

        <dt>
          Evaluation of completed and in-process projects funded by city grants:
        </dt>
        <dd>
          Once projects are funded by city grants, they tend to fall off the map. This application would encourage social media updates about city-funded projects by aggregating them onto a feed where residents could find out about updates on projects that are being built in their neighborhoods. Additionally, showcasing the projects that are being funded may encourage others with project ideas to step forward and apply for grants.

      <p>
        After considering the feasibility and impact of the identified projects, CfA Lexington decided to first work on waste management notifications. Based on the research conducted, more than 70% of calls to LexCall 311 were related to waste management, with a high percentage relating to missed pickup and confusion about pickup dates. The idea of notifications for waste pickup was also mentioned several times by the primary team in February, and the technology in use by the city provided a potentially interesting application.
