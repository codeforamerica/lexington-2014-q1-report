      <h3>Waste Management Notifications</h3>
      <p>
        The first tool CfA Lexington created is called Notify, and it lives on the web at <a href="http://notifytheton.herokuapp.com">http://notifytheton.herokuapp.com</a>. Notify helps Lexingtonians who have city trash service remember to put their Herbies, Rosies, and Lennys out on the curb the night before pickup by sending a reminder text message to those who sign up. The app also includes an admin page where an administrator can send out messages to users by pickup day; this would likely be used for days where bad weather or a holiday necessitates moving a whole day’s pickup to another day.

      <h4>Feature Ideation</h4>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p>
        Once they picked a theme and a project, CfA Lexington got to work planning out the app and what it might include. In order to do this effectively, the team employed two brainstorming tactics associated with agile development processes.
      </p>
      <p>
        The first is called <i>crazy eights</i>. In this exercise, each team member has a sheet of paper divided into eight sections. The team then has five minutes to fill each box with an idea related to the project -- these could be features, conceptual ideas, sketches, or anything else related to the project, but the goal is to fill all eight boxes. Once the five minutes is up, each team member shares what they’ve drawn without discussion or feedback. The team then does a second round of sketches, using the first round as inspiration. This exercise helps to flesh out ideas about the functionality of an application.
      </p>
      <p>
        Through this process, CfA Lexington made a list of all of the features that might be included in a waste management notifications app. This informed the second step of the process, in which the team wrote out user stories. User stories take the form of, “As a ______, I want to  _________ so I can _______.” For example, some of the many user stories for the waste management notifications app were:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>As a user, I want to know why my trash wasn’t picked up so I can ensure it is picked up in the future.</li>
        <li>As an administrator, I want to be able to message a group of subscribers based on their pickup day so I can let them know when pickup is going to be rescheduled.</li>
        <li>As a user, I want to be able to unsubscribe from text message notifications so I can opt-out conveniently.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Each of these user stories corresponded to a different potential functionality of the app, so it was  good way to figure out what a pie-in-the-sky product would feature.

      <h4>Initial Product Creation</h4>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p>
       After creating a comprehensive list of user stories, CfA Lexington determined which were the most important and therefore which functionalities should be developed for the initial prototype. The user stories process ensured that whatever we were building would be useful for the goals of the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        The initial user stories included:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>As an admin, I want to be able to send SMS messages to all users so they can learn about trash pickup information.</li>
        <li>As an admin, I want to be able to customize the content of SMS notifications so I can send an appropriate message.</li>
        <li>As a user, I want to know which waste management quad I fall into so I can see what day my trash is picked up.</li>
        <li>As a user, I want to input my phone number so I can get SMS notifications on my cell phone.</li>
        <li>As a user, I want to input my street address so I can get a localized alert.</li>
        <li>As a user, I want to input my email address so I can be contacted for feedback.</li>
        <li>As a user, I want to know the lat/lon of my address.*</li>
        <li>As a user, I want a sign-up page that respects my time so that I can sign up easily and quickly.</li>
        <li>As a user, I want to receive an SMS message the night before my trash pickup so I can remember to put my cans out.</li>
        <li>As a user, I want to be able to opt out of notifications so I can live my life.</li>
        <li>As a user, I want to see my city name when inputting my street address so I don’t input duplicate information.</li>
        <li>As a user, I want informative feedback once I’ve signed up so I understand what I’ve done.</li>
        <li>As a user, I want to ensure that I typed my address correctly so I can get the correct notification.</li>
        <li>As an admin, I want to see a map of available geographic subsets to notify.</li>
        <li>As an admin, I want to search for users based on pickup day so I can select a subset of users to notify.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p>
        Each of these user stories corresponds to functionality in the Notify application, which grew over time and through better understanding what technology was available. While some of the user stories were identified prior to development, approximately half of those that ended up being addressed by the application came up while the team was building the app. This is very common in iterative processes, which allow the latitude to change direction and add or remove features as they become more or less relevant.
