      <h3>Research Synthesis</h3>
      <p>
        Upon returning to San Francisco in March, CfA Lexington began the task of compiling and synthesizing all of the notes from meetings and research conducted in February. Because detailed notes were recorded in each of the sessions conducted, the team started by identifying problem statements from the notes collected and organizing them into categories. (A full list of problem statements can be found in Appendix B.) The categories identified were:

      <h4>Grants</h4>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p>
        In speaking with members of the community, there was a sense that neighborhood engagement could be increased if there were more resources for Lexingtonians to spearhead projects in their neighborhoods.
      </p>
      <h5>Ideas:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>A centralized site for publicity of grants offered by the city.</li>
        <li>A centralized application process for grants from the city with a mechanism for receiving updates on the application process.</li>
        <li>A centralized site for publicity of grant recipients and mechanisms for feedback from Lexingtonians.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Code Enforcement</h4>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p>
        The team discovered that there were many issues related to code enforcement, including a lack of knowledge about rules and procedures, a process that is not always easily trackable and potentially inequitable, and a reliance on paper forms that can create problems for record-keeping.
      </p>
      <h5>Ideas:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>A website to learn about code requirements in an accessible way.</li>
        <li>A digital process for code enforcement officers to enter information in the field via mobile devices (tablet / iPad).</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Neighborhood Data</h4>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p>
        As identified by the primary team, the city maintains a multitude of data related to neighborhoods that Lexingtonians would like to know about, but there are not good mechanisms for sharing that data or for Lexingtonians to request it.
      </p>
      <h5>Ideas:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>A data visualization tool to compare data between different neighborhoods.</li>
        <li>An analytical tool for LFUCG to determine neighborhood success and decline over time.</li>
      </ul>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </div>

      <h4>Neighborhood Social</h4>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p>
        Through research in February, one very clear indicator of neighborhood success and health is communication and community between neighbors. Finding information about neighborhoods is currently difficult, and it is a convoluted process to host neighborhood events.
      </p>
      <h5>Ideas:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>A neighborhood website platform that centralizes all neighborhood websites and connects with social media.</li>
        <li>A mechanism by which neighborhood association leaders can communicate with each other and share skills.</li>
      </ul>
      <br> <br> <br>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="row-fluid">
    <div class="span12">
      <h4>Community Spaces</h4>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p>
        Another indicator of neighborhood quality that emerged was the physical environment. There are not currently good mechanisms for communities to work together to learn about how to make their neighborhood spaces more robust, beautiful, and fun places to be.
      </p>
      <h5>Ideas:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>A resource to learn about sidewalk ownership and maintenance.</li>
        <li>A tool to identify vacant lots and design something to develop on them.</li>
        <li>A map and search for parks to discover amenities, events, processes for booking, etc.</li>
        <li>A site to gather updates and opinions about community projects.</li>
      </ul>

      <h4>Government Communication</h4>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p>
        LFUCG does not do a great job of proactively communicating with Lexingtonians. A large part of that problem is related to poor systems for aggregating and comparing city-managed data, but there is also a barrier between the data that exists and Lexingtonians who would like to see and use it.
      </p>
      <h5>Ideas:</h5>
      <ul>
        <li>A tool for tracking an issue (zoning, building permit, ordinance, etc.) along its lifecycle in government.</li>
        <li>A location-based text message notifications tool for city updates and information.</li>
        <li>A comprehensive search tool for government data.</li>
        <li>A digital flow-chart for indicating necessary steps for completing a desired task with the city. (I want toâ€¦)</li>
        <li>A tool for comparing and conducting analysis on city datasets.</li>
