        <h3>Individual Meetings</h3>
        <p>
        The meetings conducted by CfA Lexington in February included both LFUCG employees and engaged Lexingtonians. (A full list of individuals with whom the team met can be found in Appendix A.) Meetings were typically conducted in a question and answer format, with most meetings audio recorded and detailed minutes taken by a team member. Prior to each meeting, CfA Lexington conducted research and identified the goals of the meeting and topic areas they wished to discuss. After each meeting, the team held a debrief session during which they would discuss topics or statements that stood out, data resources that might potentially be useful, project ideas coming out of the meeting, people or organizations with whom to follow up, and general action items.

      <h4>Group Meetings</h4>

      <p>
        In addition to the individual meetings, CfA Lexington held several meetings that included groups who were interested in the project. These meetings included: two meetings with county council legislative aides, a meeting with representatives from District 10, and a meeting with representatives from District 3. These meetings were a good chance for the team to understand how issues difer in various parts of the city, with legislative aides providing information on their specific districts and residents providing a non-government perspective.

      <h4>Weekly Summary</h4>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p>Once weekly, the team would gather to discuss themes that came out of the previous week and to identify what topic areas should be focused on for the following week, including setting up meetings for the following week and deciding what information and data to potentially request from the city. This process included writing ideas and thoughts independently on post-it notes, presenting what they considered, and organizing the results into major thematic areas for consideration. This process allowed for each team member to express what they had been mulling over throughout the week while still facilitating an environment for robust discussion and debate. These meetings helped set some boundaries around the research synthesis conducted upon returning to San Francisco in March.

      <h4>CodeAcross</h4>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p>
        Additionally, CfA Lexington took on several events during February residency. On February 21, the team hosted CodeAcross, an event in February where more than 120 cities hosted volunteers working together on civic technology projects with representatives from government and the tech community -- all on the same day. The team co-hosted with OpenLexington, a group of volunteers working to create civic technologies for the city year-round. (OpenLexington is a group organized through the Code for America Brigade program, an initiative within Code for America that facilitates volunteer groups interested in civic technology around the country.)

        Lexington’s event boasted more than 50 attendees, several of whom work for LFUCG and many of whom are not developers; the oldest of attendees was 55, and the youngest was 11. At the event, there were three projects going simultaneously. There was a group working on improving <a href="http://whatsmydistrict.org">What’s My District</a>, a web application in which users can enter their Lexington address and receive a list of their congressional districts, school districts, neighborhood association, and a variety of other information; a group working on editing <a href="http://lexingtonwiki.org">LexingtonWiki</a>, a local information repository created and edited by Lexingtonians; and a group editing <a href="http://openstreetmap.org">OpenStreetMap</a>, a crowd-sourced map to which anyone can add locations. (it is colloquially known as the Wikipedia of maps!) The event was successful, and the team generated a lot of support for the Code for America program in Lexington.
