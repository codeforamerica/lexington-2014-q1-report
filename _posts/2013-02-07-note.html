      <p>In January 2014, the Code for America Lexington (CfA Lexington) team began meeting and training in San Francisco, initiating a year of working with Lexington-Fayette Urban County Government (LFUCG) to build a technology product or products for the city to use in pursuit of improving quality of life in Lexingtonâ€™s neighborhoods.
</p>

    <p>On January 23rd, 2014, CfA Lexington had a phone call with the primary team from LFUCG to identify some areas in which the city would like improvement and determine some goals for the year. The phone call included Aldona Valicenti (Chief Innovation Officer), Shaye Rabold (Special Advisor to the Mayor), Jamie Emmons (Chief of Staff for the Mayor), Chad Cottle (Director of Enterprise Solutions), Derek Paulsen (Commissioner of Planning), and Wes Holbrook (Policy Advisor to the Mayor). During this meeting, the primary team identified some goals for the year. These included:
</p>
    <ul>
      <li>A project based on improving quality of life.</li>
      <li>A focus on an outward-facing tool for Lexingtonians.</li>
      <li>An interesting tool that has a hook for engagement from Lexingtonians.</li>
      <li>An increase in engagement between LFUCG and Lexingtonians with a focus on proactive communication.</li>
      <li>Identification of issues that may have technological solutions within LFUCG and the city of Lexington.</li>
      <li>Identification of existing tools and applications that may be able to be redeployed in Lexington.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>
    With these goals in mind, the primary team and CfA Lexington scheduled in-person meetings for the month of February to learn as much as possible about the city and some potential problem areas. During the month, CfA Lexington met with more than 70 individuals both inside government and in the community and gathered input related to the previously identified goals. The team also participated in conversations and activities with the greater Lexington community, including speaking with a group of Girl Scouts about getting involved with technology.
    </p>

    <p>Equipped with a month of findings, the team returned to San Francisco at the beginning of March to synthesize their research and identify emerging themes. Through writing out problem statements, brainstorming ideas, consulting with other city teams, and categorizing findings, the team identified six major themes to potentially pursue:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li>Grants</li>
      <li>Code Enforcement</li>
      <li>Neighborhood Data</li>
      <li>Neighborhood Social</li>
      <li>Community Spaces</li>
      <li>Government Communication</li>
    </ul>

    <p>From those six themes came eight potential project ideas, and the team chose to experiment with a few of them over the first part of the fellowship. For the first experiment, CfA Lexington chose to pursue a text message notifications app for waste management, where Lexingtonians could enter an address and a phone number and receive reminders prior to their solid waste pickup days.
    </p>

    <p>During the process of developing the app, CfA Lexington also conducted further research into some of the other topic areas identified in early March. That research and reopening of scope necessitated further information gathering from Lexingtonians, particularly in the areas of neighborhood data, community spaces, and government communication. The team will return to Lexington in mid-April to not only gather feedback and user research about the prototype of their notifications app, and to conduct further interviews and research regarding some potential topic areas for projects moving forward.</p>

    <p>CfA Lexington will return to San Francisco after the April trip to decide next steps for the notifications app and continue pursuit of projects in a few of the other topic areas based on the interviews and research collected. The process will be very similar to that of early March, involving the definition of problem statements, brainstorming of ideas, consultations with other city teams, and categorizing findings. From here, the team will identify another project or projects to pursue while remaining in close communication with the primary team in Lexington.</p>
