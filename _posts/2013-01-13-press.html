      <h3>Next Steps</h3>
      <p>
        As CfA Lexington gears up for its first trip back to Lexington, the team hopes to not only conduct user research on the Notify app, but also move the needle on several other initiatives. These include:

      <p>
       After creating a comprehensive list of user stories, CfA Lexington determined which were the most important and therefore which functionalities should be developed for the initial prototype. The user stories process ensured that whatever we were building would be useful for the goals of the app.
      </p>
      <p>
        The initial user stories included:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Working with OpenLexington on smaller projects and planning more events, including National Day of Civic Hacking.</li>
        <li>Collecting user research about the types of notifications from LFUCG that Lexingtonians may be interested in.</li>
        <li>Interviewing LFUCG employees in departments that we identified as potential further users of notifications in the city, including Water Quality and Parks & Recreation</li>
        <li>Assess new insights from April visit and reassess original problem statements to identify where we can have the impact weâ€™re aiming for.</li>
      </ul>
      <div class="line"></div>
      <p>
        Each of these user stories corresponds to functionality in the Notify application, which grew over time and through better understanding what technology was available. While some of the user stories were identified prior to development, approximately half of those that ended up being addressed by the application came up while the team was building the app. This is very common in iterative processes, which allow the latitude to change direction and add or remove features as they become more or less relevant.
