      <h3>Next Steps</h3>
      <p>
        As CfA Lexington gears up for its first trip back to Lexington, the team hopes to not only conduct user research on the Notify app, but also move the needle on several other initiatives. These include:

       After creating a comprehensive list of user stories, CfA Lexington determined which were the most important and therefore which functionalities should be developed for the initial prototype. The user stories process ensured that whatever we were building would be useful for the goals of the app.

        The initial user stories included:
      <br> <br>
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Working with OpenLexington on smaller projects and planning more events, including National Day of Civic Hacking.</li>
        <li>Conducting user research to gather information and feedback on communications between LFUCG and Lexingtonians.</li>
        <li>Interviewing LFUCG employees and community members to learn more about other areas that may be interesting to pursue for future projects.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        <br>
          After the trip, the team intends to leverage new insights from the visit and reassess the original problem statements to better guide the project toward creating significant impact. The process moving forward will closely mimic the process undertaken in February, with brainstorming, ideation, user stories, and prototyping.
